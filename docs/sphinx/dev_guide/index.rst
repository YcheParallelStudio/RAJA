RAJA Developers' Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes key aspects of the RAJA development process and 
provides a set of coding guidelines for RAJA. The guide is intended
for RAJA core developers and contributors and for "on-boarding" new
team members and contributors. The aim is that all RAJA code is developed
following similar practices to ensure that it is robust, consistent, 
easily understood and used, and tested and documented well. Anyone 
who contributes to RAJA should be aware of and follow these guidelines. 

The guidelines should not be viewed as static; they should evolve with
project needs and improved when there are better ways of doing things. 
Changes should be agreed to by the core development team after assessing their
merits based on the teams collective professional judgment. Also, the 
benefits of uniformity should be balanced with allowances for individual 
stylistic preferences, which may be superior in certain situations. 
When changes are made, these guidelines should be updated accordingly.
