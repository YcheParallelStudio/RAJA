RAJA Developers' Guide
=========================================================

This document describes the RAJA development process and provide a basic set 
of code development guidelines for RAJA. The intent is to ensure that RAJA 
code is robust, easily understood, developed uniformly, tested well, and 
documented well. Folks who contribute to RAJA development should be 
aware of and follow these guidelines. 

The guidelines are not meant to be static, but rather to evolve with the 
needs of the project and should be changed as needed. Changes should
be based on development team discussion using their collective
professional judgment. Also, the benefits of consistency should be balanced
with variations that allow for individual stylistic preferences and which may
be preferable in certain circumstances. When changes are made, these
guidelines must be updated accordingly.
