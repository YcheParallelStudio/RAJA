=======================
Index of RAJA Examples
=======================

.. warning:: Under construction!
             This section will contain a list of RAJA code examples along with
             a basic explanation for each that we will build up over time 
             (e.g., see note at top of the previous section :doc:`primer`). 
             We can also add a link to the source code for each example. If 
             each of us writes a few examples that nicely show different RAJA 
             usage patterns, we can have a helpful RAJA introduction built up 
             for users pretty quickly.
