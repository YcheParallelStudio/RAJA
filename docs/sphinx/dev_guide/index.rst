RAJA Developers' Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes key aspects of the RAJA development process and 
provides a basic set of codingg guidelines for RAJA. The intent 
is that all RAJA code is written following some core practices to ensure 
that RAJA code is developed consistently, easily understood, tested and 
documented well, and robust. Folks who contribute to RAJA should be 
aware of and follow these guidelines. 

The guidelines are not meant to be static, but rather to evolve with the 
project and improved as needed. Changes should be agreed to by the 
core developers and based on their collective professional judgment. 
Also, the benefits of uniformity should be balanced with allowances for 
individual stylistic preferences, which may be preferable in certain 
circumstances. When changes are made, these guidelines should be updated 
accordingly.
