RAJA Developers' Guide
=========================================================

This document describes key aspects of the RAJA development process and 
provides a basic set of code development guidelines for RAJA. The intent 
is have a lightweight set of common prctices that help to ensure that RAJA 
code is robust, easily understood, developed consistently, and tested and 
documented well. Folks who contribute to RAJA development should be 
aware of and follow these guidelines. 

The guidelines are not meant to be static, but rather to evolve with the 
needs of the project and should be changed as needed. Changes should
be based on development team discussion using the collective professional 
judgment of team members. Also, the benefits of uniformity should be balanced
with variations that allow for individual stylistic preferences and which may
be preferable in certain circumstances. When changes are made, these
guidelines should be updated accordingly.
