RAJA Developers' Guide
=========================================================

Thee guidelines provide a basic set of code development conventions 
for RAJA development. Their intent is to ensure that RAJA code is
robust, easily understood, developed uniformly, tested well, and 
documented well. Folks who contribute to RAJA development should be 
aware of and follow these conventions. However, the guidelines are 
not meant to be static, but rather to evolve with the needs of project 
developers and should be changed when needed. Changes should
be based on discussion by the development team using their collective
professional judgment. Also, the benefits of consistency should be balanced
with variations that allow for individual stylistic preferences and which may
be preferable in specific code circumstances. When changes are made, these
guidelines must be updated accordingly.
